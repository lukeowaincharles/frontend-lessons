A foundation for beginners to learn from.

## Where to start
There is some setup required before coding can start.
You will need to download a code editor, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSCode</a> is a good place to start.
You will need something to run the code locally: <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mamp</a> for Mac or <a href="https://www.wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wamp</a> for Windows.

There are also a few things you will need to download by using the `terminal`:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node</a>: can also run `brew install node`</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Npm</a>: can also run `brew install npm`</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git</a>: `brew install git`</li>
</ul>

It would be good to setup a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github account</a>, this is where you can store code.
